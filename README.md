# RecipeBox

RecipeBox is a feature-rich recipe web application built using **React** for the frontend, **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Firebase** for backend functionality. It allows users to explore recipes fetched from the **Spoonacular API**, authenticate their accounts, and save their favorite recipes.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration using Firebase Authentication.
- **Protected Routes**: Ensures only authenticated users can access certain parts of the app.
- **Recipe Search**: Fetches and displays recipes dynamically from the Spoonacular API.
- **Favorites Management**: Allows users to save and view their favorite recipes.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I:

- Learned how to create and manage **protected routes** in React.
- Gained experience with **Firebase** for user authentication and database management.
- Deepened my understanding of the **React Context API** and how to create **custom hooks** for better state and logic management.
- Overcame challenges with setting up Firebase by leveraging resources like YouTube tutorials, blogs, and AI assistance.

## Challenges and Growth

Setting up Firebase was initially challenging, but with persistence and resourcefulness, I was able to resolve the issues and gain a solid understanding of its integration with React.

This project served as the capstone for a bootcamp I completed with **Trestle Academy**, and it provided a platform to apply the skills I learned during the program.

## Next Steps

I plan to:

- Continue building on this project to explore more advanced features.
- Improve user experience by adding more interactivity and features.
- Tackle more complex challenges in web development to grow as a developer.
